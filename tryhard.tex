\maketitle
There are $n$ balls rolling along a line in one direction and $k$ balls rolling along the same line in the opposite direction. The speeds of the balls in the first group and in the second group are equal, and their masses are identical. Initially the two groups of balls are separated from one another and at some point the balls start colliding. The collisions are assumed to be elastic. How many collisions will there be?

Solution: As the collisions are elastic, and the masses are identical, the balls exchange their velocities. But this is the same as the balls passing through each other! Therefore there are $n\times k$ collisions
